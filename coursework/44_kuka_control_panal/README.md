# Kuka Python Control Panal 
Objective :
    1.Connect Vrep Simulator to a python script
    2.python GUI to control Kuka's 7 joints each has rotation range -180 to 180 degrees  

## To run this script : 
    1.open Kuka.ttt 
    2.run the simulation
    3.Interminal: run python script: Kuka_control_panel.py
    
### watch the demo

### P.S. 
    For these scripts : 
        simpleTest.py
        simpleSynchronousTest.py
        pathPlanningTest.py
        complexCommandTest.py

    I think that they have no Importance for my script "Kuka_control_panel.py"
    you can neglect them or delete them if you want
    but I kept them as they can be used as refrences for future projects !
