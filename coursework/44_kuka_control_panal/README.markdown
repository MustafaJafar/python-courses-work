# Kuka Python Control Panal 
    Objective :
       1.Connect Vrep Simulator to a python script

## To run this script : 
    1.open Kuka.ttt 
    2.run the simulation

### P.S.
    I tried adding a pyplot to show the robot's camera but I couldn't
    maybe it needed to be in another thread "I couldn't use multithreading at that that time"
    so I made a button to show the current view but it won't update automatically!

### P.P.S. 
    For these scripts : 
        simpleTest.py
        simpleSynchronousTest.py
        pathPlanningTest.py
        complexCommandTest.py

    I think that they have no Importance for my script "Kuka_control_panel.py"
    you can neglect them or delete them if you want
    but I kept them as they can be used as refrences for future projects !
